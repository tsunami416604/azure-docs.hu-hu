# <a name="monitor-and-collect-data-from-ml-web-service-endpoints"></a>Monitor and collect data from ML web service endpoints
[!INCLUDE [applies-to-skus](../../../includes/aml-applies-to-basic-enterprise-sku.md)]

In this article, you learn how to collect data from and monitor models deployed to web service endpoints in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Instances (ACI) by enabling Azure Application Insights. In addition to collecting an endpoint's input data and response, you can monitor:

* Request rates, response times, and failure rates
* Dependency rates, response times, and failure rates
* Kivételek

[Learn more about Azure Application Insights](../../azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview.md). 


## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Előfeltételek

* If you don’t have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) today

* An Azure Machine Learning workspace, a local directory that contains your scripts, and the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python installed. To learn how to get these prerequisites, see [How to configure a development environment](how-to-configure-environment.md)
* A trained machine learning model to be deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Instance (ACI). If you don't have one, see the [Train image classification model](tutorial-train-models-with-aml.md) tutorial

## <a name="web-service-input-and-response-data"></a>Web service input and response data

The input and response to the service - corresponding to the inputs to the ML model and its prediction - are logged to the Azure Application Insights traces under the message `"model_data_collection"`. You can query Azure Application Insights directly to access this data, or set up a [continuous export](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/export-telemetry) to a storage account for longer retention or further processing. Model data can then be used in the Azure ML service to setup labeling, retraining, explainability, data analysis, or other use. 

## <a name="use-the-azure-portal-to-configure"></a>Use the Azure portal to configure

You can enable and disable Azure Application Insights in the Azure portal. 

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your workspace

1. On the **Deployments** tab, select the service where you want to enable Azure Application Insights

   [![List of services on the Deployments tab](media/how-to-enable-app-insights/Deployments.PNG)](./media/how-to-enable-app-insights/Deployments.PNG#lightbox)

3. Select **Edit**

   [![Edit button](media/how-to-enable-app-insights/Edit.PNG)](./media/how-to-enable-app-insights/Edit.PNG#lightbox)

4. In **Advanced Settings**, select the **Enable AppInsights diagnostics** check box

   [![Selected check box for enabling diagnostics](media/how-to-enable-app-insights/AdvancedSettings.png)](./media/how-to-enable-app-insights/AdvancedSettings.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Update** at the bottom of the screen to apply the changes

### <a name="disable"></a>Letiltás

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your workspace
1. Select **Deployments**, select the service, and then select **Edit**

   [![Use the edit button](media/how-to-enable-app-insights/Edit.PNG)](./media/how-to-enable-app-insights/Edit.PNG#lightbox)

1. In **Advanced Settings**, clear the **Enable AppInsights diagnostics** check box

   [![Cleared check box for enabling diagnostics](media/how-to-enable-app-insights/uncheck.png)](./media/how-to-enable-app-insights/uncheck.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Update** at the bottom of the screen to apply the changes
 
## <a name="use-python-sdk-to-configure"></a>Use Python SDK to configure 

### <a name="update-a-deployed-service"></a>Update a deployed service

1. Identify the service in your workspace. The value for `ws` is the name of your workspace

    ```python
    from azureml.core.webservice import Webservice
    aks_service= Webservice(ws, "my-service-name")
    ```
2. Update your service and enable Azure Application Insights

    ```python
    aks_service.update(enable_app_insights=True)
    ```

### <a name="log-custom-traces-in-your-service"></a>Log custom traces in your service

If you want to log custom traces, follow the standard deployment process for AKS or ACI in the [How to deploy and where](how-to-deploy-and-where.md) document. Then use the following steps:

1. Update the scoring file by adding print statements
    
    ```python
    print ("model initialized" + time.strftime("%H:%M:%S"))
    ```

2. Update the service configuration
    
    ```python
    config = Webservice.deploy_configuration(enable_app_insights=True)
    ```

3. Build an image and deploy it on [AKS](how-to-deploy-to-aks.md) or [ACI](how-to-deploy-to-aci.md)

### <a name="disable-tracking-in-python"></a>Disable tracking in Python

To disable Azure Application Insights, use the following code:

```python 
## replace <service_name> with the name of the web service
<service_name>.update(enable_app_insights=False)
```

## <a name="evaluate-data"></a>Evaluate data
Your service's data is stored in your Azure Application Insights account, within the same resource group as Azure Machine Learning.
To view it:

1. Go to your Machine Learning service workspace in [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com) and click on Application Insights link

    [![AppInsightsLoc](media/how-to-enable-app-insights/AppInsightsLoc.png)](./media/how-to-enable-app-insights/AppInsightsLoc.png#lightbox)

1. Select the **Overview** tab to see a basic set of metrics for your service

   [![Overview](media/how-to-enable-app-insights/overview.png)](./media/how-to-enable-app-insights/overview.png#lightbox)

1. To look into your web service input and response payloads, select **Analytics**
1. In the schema section, select **Traces** and filter down traces with the message `"model_data_collection"`. In the custom dimensions, you can see the inputs, predictions, and other relevant details

   [![Model data](media/how-to-enable-app-insights/model-data-trace.png)](./media/how-to-enable-app-insights/model-data-trace.png#lightbox)


3. To look into your custom traces, select **Analytics**
4. In the schema section, select **Traces**. Then select **Run** to run your query. Data should appear in a table format and should map to your custom calls in your scoring file

   [![Custom traces](media/how-to-enable-app-insights/logs.png)](./media/how-to-enable-app-insights/logs.png#lightbox)

To learn more about how to use Azure Application Insights, see [What is Application Insights?](../../azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview.md).

## <a name="export-data-for-further-processing-and-longer-retention"></a>Export data for further processing and longer retention

You can use Azure Application Insights' [continuous export](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/export-telemetry) to send messages to a supported storage account, where a longer retention can be set. The `"model_data_collection"` messages are stored in JSON format and can be easily parsed to extract model data. Azure Data Factory, Azure ML Pipelines, or other data processing tools can be used to transform the data as needed. When you have transformed the data, you can then register it with the Azure Machine Learning workspace as a dataset. To do so, see [How to create and register datasets](how-to-create-register-datasets.md).
