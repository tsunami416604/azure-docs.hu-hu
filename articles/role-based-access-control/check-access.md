You can use the **Access control (IAM)** blade in [role-based access control (RBAC)](overview.md) to view the access a user or another security principal has to Azure resources. However, sometimes you just need to quickly view the access for a single user or another security principal. The easiest way to do this is to use the **Check access** feature in the Azure portal.

 The way that you view the access for a user is to list their roles assignments. Follow these steps to view the role assignments for a single user, group, service principal, or managed identity at the subscription scope.

1. In the Azure portal, click **All services** and then **Subscriptions**.

1. Click your subscription.

1. Kattintson a **Hozzáférés-vezérlés (IAM)** elemre.

1. Click the **Check access** tab.

    On this pane, you can see the roles assigned to the selected security principal and the scope. If there are any deny assignments at this scope or inherited to this scope, they will be listed.
