# <a name="understand-deny-assignments-for-azure-resources"></a>Understand deny assignments for Azure resources

Similar to a role assignment, a *deny assignment* attaches a set of deny actions to a user, group, or service principal at a particular scope for the purpose of denying access. Deny assignments block users from performing specific Azure resource actions even if a role assignment grants them access.

This article describes how deny assignments are defined.

## <a name="how-deny-assignments-are-created"></a>How deny assignments are created

Deny assignments are created and managed by Azure to protect resources. Azure Blueprints and Azure managed apps use deny assignments to protect system-managed resources. Azure Blueprints and Azure managed apps are the only way that deny assignments can be created. You can't directly create your own deny assignments.  For more information, see [Protect new resources with Azure Blueprints resource locks](../governance/blueprints/tutorials/protect-new-resources.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can't directly create your own deny assignments.

## <a name="compare-role-assignments-and-deny-assignments"></a>Compare role assignments and deny assignments

Deny assignments follow a similar pattern as role assignments, but also have some differences.

## <a name="deny-assignment-properties"></a>Deny assignment properties

 A deny assignment has the following properties:

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> | Tulajdonság | Szükséges | Type (Típus) | Leírás |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | `DenyAssignmentName` | Igen | Sztring | The display name of the deny assignment. Names must be unique for a given scope. |
> | `Description` | Nem | Sztring | The description of the deny assignment. |
> | `Permissions.Actions` | At least one Actions or one DataActions | String[] | An array of strings that specify the management operations to which the deny assignment blocks access. |
> | `Permissions.NotActions` | Nem | String[] | An array of strings that specify the management operations to exclude from the deny assignment. |
> | `Permissions.DataActions` | At least one Actions or one DataActions | String[] | An array of strings that specify the data operations to which the deny assignment blocks access. |
> | `Permissions.NotDataActions` | Nem | String[] | An array of strings that specify the data operations to exclude from the deny assignment. |
> | `Scope` | Nem | Sztring | A string that specifies the scope that the deny assignment applies to. |
> | `DoNotApplyToChildScopes` | Nem | Logikai | Specifies whether the deny assignment applies to child scopes. Default value is false. |
> | `Principals[i].Id` | Igen | String[] | An array of Azure AD principal object IDs (user, group, service principal, or managed identity) to which the deny assignment applies. Set to an empty GUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` to represent all principals. |
> | `Principals[i].Type` | Nem | String[] | An array of object types represented by Principals[i].Id. Set to `SystemDefined` to represent all principals. |
> | `ExcludePrincipals[i].Id` | Nem | String[] | An array of Azure AD principal object IDs (user, group, service principal, or managed identity) to which the deny assignment does not apply. |
> | `ExcludePrincipals[i].Type` | Nem | String[] | An array of object types represented by ExcludePrincipals[i].Id. |
> | `IsSystemProtected` | Nem | Logikai | Specifies whether this deny assignment was created by Azure and cannot be edited or deleted. Currently, all deny assignments are system protected. |

## <a name="the-all-principals-principal"></a>The All Principals principal

To support deny assignments, a system-defined principal named *All Principals* has been introduced. This principal represents all users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in an Azure AD directory. If the principal ID is a zero GUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` and the principal type is `SystemDefined`, the principal represents all principals. In Azure PowerShell output, All Principals looks like the following:

```azurepowershell
Principals              : {
                          DisplayName:  All Principals
                          ObjectType:   SystemDefined
                          ObjectId:     00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
                          }
```

All Principals can be combined with `ExcludePrincipals` to deny all principals except some users. All Principals has the following constraints:

- Can be used only in `Principals` and cannot be used in `ExcludePrincipals`.
- `Principals[i].Type` must be set to `SystemDefined`.
