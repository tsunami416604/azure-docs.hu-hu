# <a name="manage-user-settings-with-azure-multi-factor-authentication-in-the-cloud"></a>Manage user settings with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication in the cloud

As an administrator, you can manage the following user and device settings:

* Require users to provide contact methods again
* Delete app passwords
* Require MFA on all trusted devices

## <a name="manage-authentication-methods"></a>Manage authentication methods

As an administrator assigned the Authentication Administrator role you can require users to reset their password, re-register for MFA, or revoke existing MFA sessions from their user object.

1. Jelentkezzen be az [Azure portálra](https://portal.azure.com).
1. On the left, select **Azure Active Directory** > **Users** > **All users**.
1. Choose the user you wish to perform an action on and select **Authentication methods**.
   - **Reset Password** will reset the user's password and assign a temporary password that must be changed on the next sign in.
   - **Require Re-register MFA** will make it so that when the user signs in next time, they will be requested to setup a new MFA authentication method.
   - **Revoke MFA Sessions** clears the user's remembered MFA sessions and requires them to perform MFA the next time it is required by the policy on the device.

## <a name="delete-users-existing-app-passwords"></a>Delete users existing app passwords

This setting deletes all of the app passwords that a user has created. Non-browser apps that were associated with these app passwords stop working until a new app password is created. Global administrator permissions are required to perform this action.
