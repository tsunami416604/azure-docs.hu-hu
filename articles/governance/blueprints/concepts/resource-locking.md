# <a name="understand-resource-locking-in-azure-blueprints"></a>Understand resource locking in Azure Blueprints

The creation of consistent environments at scale is only truly valuable if there's a mechanism to maintain that consistency. This article explains how resource locking works in Azure Blueprints. To see an example of resource locking and application of _deny assignments_, see the [protecting new resources](../tutorials/protect-new-resources.md) tutorial.

## <a name="locking-modes-and-states"></a>Locking modes and states

Locking Mode applies to the blueprint assignment and it has three options: **Don't Lock**, **Read Only**, or **Do Not Delete**. The locking mode is configured during artifact deployment during a blueprint assignment. A different locking mode can be set by updating the blueprint assignment.
Locking modes, however, can't be changed outside of Blueprints.

Resources created by artifacts in a blueprint assignment have four states: **Not Locked**, **Read Only**, **Cannot Edit / Delete**, or **Cannot Delete**. Each artifact type can be in the **Not Locked** state. The following table can be used to determine the state of a resource:

|Mód|Artifact Resource Type|Állami|Leírás|
|-|-|-|-|
|Don't Lock|*|Not Locked|Resources aren't protected by Blueprints. This state is also used for resources added to a **Read Only** or **Do Not Delete** resource group artifact from outside a blueprint assignment.|
|Csak olvasási engedély|Erőforráscsoport|Cannot Edit / Delete|The resource group is read only and tags on the resource group can't be modified. **Not Locked** resources can be added, moved, changed, or deleted from this resource group.|
|Csak olvasási engedély|Non-resource group|Csak olvasási engedély|The resource can't be altered in any way -- no changes and it can't be deleted.|
|Do Not Delete|*|Cannot Delete|The resources can be altered, but can't be deleted. **Not Locked** resources can be added, moved, changed, or deleted from this resource group.|

## <a name="overriding-locking-states"></a>Overriding locking states

It's typically possible for someone with appropriate [role-based access control](../../../role-based-access-control/overview.md) (RBAC) on the subscription, such as the 'Owner' role, to be allowed to alter or delete any resource. This access isn't the case when Blueprints applies locking as part of a deployed assignment. If the assignment was set with the **Read Only** or **Do Not Delete** option, not even the subscription owner can perform the blocked action on the protected resource.

This security measure protects the consistency of the defined blueprint and the environment it was designed to create from accidental or programmatic deletion or alteration.

## <a name="removing-locking-states"></a>Removing locking states

If it becomes necessary to modify or delete a resource protected by an assignment, there are two ways to do so.

- Updating the blueprint assignment to a locking mode of **Don't Lock**
- Delete the blueprint assignment

When the assignment is removed, the locks created by Blueprints are removed. However, the resource is left behind and would need to be deleted through normal means.

## <a name="how-blueprint-locks-work"></a>How blueprint locks work

An RBAC [deny assignments](../../../role-based-access-control/deny-assignments.md) deny action is applied to artifact resources during assignment of a blueprint if the assignment selected the **Read Only** or **Do Not Delete** option. The deny action is added by the managed identity of the blueprint assignment and can only be removed from the artifact resources by the same managed identity. This security measure enforces the locking mechanism and prevents removing the blueprint lock outside Blueprints.

![Blueprint deny assignment on resource group](../media/resource-locking/blueprint-deny-assignment.png)

The [deny assignment properties](../../../role-based-access-control/deny-assignments.md#deny-assignment-properties) of each mode are as follows:

|Mód |Permissions.Actions |Permissions.NotActions |Principals[i].Type |ExcludePrincipals[i].Id | DoNotApplyToChildScopes |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Csak olvasási engedély |**\*** |**\*/read** |SystemDefined (Everyone) |blueprint assignment and user-defined in **excludedPrincipals** |Resource group - _true_; Resource - _false_ |
|Do Not Delete |**\*/delete** | |SystemDefined (Everyone) |blueprint assignment and user-defined in **excludedPrincipals** |Resource group - _true_; Resource - _false_ |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Resource Manager caches role assignment details for up to 30 minutes. As a result, deny assignments deny action's on blueprint resources may not immediately be in full effect. During this period of time, it might be possible to delete a resource intended to be protected by blueprint locks.

## <a name="exclude-a-principal-from-a-deny-assignment"></a>Exclude a principal from a deny assignment

In some design or security scenarios, it may be necessary to exclude a principal from the [deny assignment](../../../role-based-access-control/deny-assignments.md) the blueprint assignment creates. This is done in REST API by adding up to five values to the **excludedPrincipals** array in the **locks** property when [creating the assignment](/rest/api/blueprints/assignments/createorupdate). This is an example of a request body that includes **excludedPrincipals**:

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "type": "SystemAssigned"
  },
  "location": "eastus",
  "properties": {
    "description": "enforce pre-defined simpleBlueprint to this XXXXXXXX subscription.",
    "blueprintId": "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{mgId}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/simpleBlueprint",
    "locks": {
        "mode": "AllResourcesDoNotDelete",
        "excludedPrincipals": [

            "38833b56-194d-420b-90ce-cff578296714"
        ]
    },
    "parameters": {
      "storageAccountType": {

      },
      "owners": {
        "value": [
          "johnDoe@contoso.com",
          "johnsteam@contoso.com"
        ]
      }
    },
    "resourceGroups": {
      "storageRG": {
        "name": "defaultRG",
        "location": "eastus"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
