# <a name="control-mapping-of-the-irs-1075-blueprint-sample"></a>Control mapping of the IRS 1075 blueprint sample

The following article details how the Azure Blueprints IRS 1075 blueprint sample maps to the IRS 1075 controls. For more information about the controls, see [IRS 1075](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1075.pdf).

The following mappings are to the **IRS 1075** controls. Use the navigation on the right to jump directly to a specific control mapping. Many of the mapped controls are implemented with an [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) initiative. To review the complete initiative, open **Policy** in the Azure portal and select the **Definitions** page. Then, find and select the **\[Preview\]: Audit IRS 1075 controls and deploy specific VM Extensions to support audit requirements** built-in policy initiative.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each control below is associated with one or more [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) definitions. These policies may help you [assess compliance](../../../policy/how-to/get-compliance-data.md) with the control; however, there often is not a 1:1 or complete match between a control and one or more policies. As such, **Compliant** in Azure Policy refers only to the policies themselves; this doesn't ensure you're fully compliant with all requirements of a control. In addition, the compliance standard includes controls that aren't addressed by any Azure Policy definitions at this time. Therefore, compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your overall compliance status. The associations between controls and Azure Policy definitions for this compliance blueprint sample may change over time. To view the change history, see the [GitHub Commit History](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/commits/master/articles/governance/blueprints/samples/irs-1075/control-mapping.md).

## <a name="9321-ac-2-account-management"></a>9.3.2.1 AC-2 Account Management

This blueprint helps you review accounts that may not comply with your organization's account management requirements. This blueprint assigns [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) definitions that audit external accounts with read, write and owner permissions on a subscription and deprecated accounts. By reviewing the accounts audited by these policies, you can take appropriate action to ensure account management requirements are met.

- Deprecated accounts should be removed from your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with read permissions should be removed from your subscription
- Írási engedélyekkel rendelkező külső fiókokat el kell távolítani az előfizetésből

## <a name="9321-ac-2-7-account-management--role-based-schemes"></a>9.3.2.1 AC-2 (7) Account Management | Role-Based Schemes

Azure implements [role-based access control](../../../../role-based-access-control/overview.md) (RBAC) to help you manage who has access to resources in Azure. Using the Azure portal, you can review who has access to Azure resources and their permissions. This blueprint also assigns [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) definitions to audit use of Azure Active Directory authentication for SQL Servers and Service Fabric. Using Azure Active Directory authentication enables simplified permission management and centralized identity management of database users and other Microsoft services. Additionally, this blueprint assigns an Azure Policy definition to audit the use of custom RBAC rules. Understanding where custom RBAC rules are implemented can help you verify need and proper implementation, as custom RBAC rules are error prone.

- An Azure Active Directory administrator should be provisioned for SQL servers
- Audit usage of custom RBAC rules
- Service Fabric clusters should only use Azure Active Directory for client authentication

## <a name="9321-ac-2-12-account-management--account-monitoring--atypical-usage"></a>9.3.2.1 AC-2 (12) Account Management | Account Monitoring / Atypical Usage

## <a name="9315-ac-5-separation-of-duties"></a>9.3.1.5 AC-5 Separation of Duties

Having only one Azure subscription owner doesn't allow for administrative redundancy. Conversely, having too many Azure subscription owners can increase the potential for a breach via a compromised owner account. This blueprint helps you maintain an appropriate number of Azure subscription owners by assigning [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) definitions that audit the number of owners for Azure subscriptions. This blueprint also assigns Azure Policy definitions that help you control membership of the Administrators group on Windows virtual machines. Managing subscription owner and virtual machine administrator permissions can help you implement appropriate separation of duties.

Reviewing these account indicators can help you ensure least privilege controls are implemented.

- A maximum of 3 owners should be designated for your subscription
- Audit Windows VMs in which the Administrators group contains any of the specified members
- Audit Windows VMs in which the Administrators group does not contain all of the specified members
- Deploy requirements to audit Windows VMs in which the Administrators group contains any of the specified members
