### <a name="content-protection"></a>Tartalomvédelem

When streaming content protected with token restriction, end users need to obtain a token that is sent as part of the key delivery request. The *Token Replay Prevention* feature allows Media Services customers to set a limit on how many times the same token can be used to request a key or a license. For more information, see [Token Replay Prevention](content-protection-overview.md#token-replay-prevention).

This feature is currently available in US Central and US West Central.

### <a name="video-subclipping"></a>Video subclipping

You can now trim or subclip a video when encoding it using a [Job](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/jobs). 

This functionality works with any [Transform](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/transforms) that is built using either the [BuiltInStandardEncoderPreset](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/transforms/createorupdate#builtinstandardencoderpreset) presets, or the [StandardEncoderPreset](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/transforms/createorupdate#standardencoderpreset) presets. 

See examples:

* [Subclip a video with .NET](subclip-video-dotnet-howto.md)
* [Subclip a video with REST](subclip-video-rest-howto.md)

## <a name="december-2018"></a>2018. december

Updates from the GA release of the V3 API include:
       
* The **PresentationTimeRange** properties are no longer 'required' for **Asset Filters** and **Account Filters**. 
* The $top and $skip query options for **Jobs** and **Transforms** have been removed and $orderby was added. As part of adding the new ordering functionality, it was discovered that the $top and $skip options had accidentally been exposed previously even though they are not implemented.
* Enumeration extensibility was re-enabled. This feature was enabled in the preview versions of the SDK and got accidentally disabled in the GA version.
* Two predefined streaming policies have been renamed. **SecureStreaming** is now **MultiDrmCencStreaming**. **SecureStreamingWithFairPlay** is now **Predefined_MultiDrmStreaming**.
